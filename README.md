# Intern_Project_1

This is a webpage that provides with the weather conditions of any place made with the help of html css and js and with an integration of API.
For the weather information, an API is used from https://openweathermap.org/ .
With the help of this project I got to learn about javascript and APIs and how to use API for your project.
